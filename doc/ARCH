This document explains the directory structure used

I have tried to apply the unix directory structure to the application, so it
should be fairly easy to understand.

Basic structure is:

bin  cache  doc  etc  images  lib  pub  usr  var

The meaning of them not surprisingly is:

bin     - helper binaries for the application, like cronjobs and release scripts
cache   - assets cache for images, javascript and css files (could be inside var)
doc     - documents and simple explanation files are this one here
etc     - configuration files used by the application
images  - uploaded images used by the application (could be inside var)
lib     - generic re-usable php library with one file per class
pub     - directory accessible from http with public data
usr     - user generated application development files for dao, model and resource
var     - variable length data generated by the application as logs, cache, images
